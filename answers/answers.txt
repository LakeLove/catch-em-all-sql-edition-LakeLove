### Part 3: Joins and Groups
# How many pokemon at level 100 does each trainer with at least one level 100 pokemone have? (Hint: your query should not display a trainer

# How many pokemon only belong to one trainer and no other?

### Part 4: Final Report

Directions: Write a query that returns the following collumns:

| Pokemon Name | Trainer Name | Level | Primary Type | Secondary Type |
|:------------:|:------------:|:-----:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| Pokemon's name| Trainer's name| Current Level| Primary Type Name| Secondary Type Name|

Sort the data by finding out which trainer has the strongest pokemon so that this will act as a ranking of strongest to weakest trainer. You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want, but you will have to explain your decision.
